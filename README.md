# BuzzMovieSelector
      Alex Wu, Ryang Phan, Joon Gyu Choi, Zhijian Chen, and I 
      built a basic mobile application that serves as a movie 
      information and referral site for Georgia Tech students. 
      To support the site, we accessed a set of REST services 
      from Open Movie DB (http://www.omdbapi.com/). This 
      application allows students to share private 
      recommendations and comments about movies they have 
      seen, and to rank movies. Movie rankings can be reported 
      overall, or by student major.
